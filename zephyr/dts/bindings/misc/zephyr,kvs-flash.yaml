description: Key Value Store on flash partition

compatible: "zephyr,kvs-flash"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  partition:
    type: phandle
    required: true
    description: |
      Backing storage flash partition.

  block-size:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      The block-size specifies how to divide the flash partition into blocks.
      The block-size should be a power of 2.

  free-size:
    type: int
    description: |
      To ensure no data is lost during garbage collection some area should 
      always be free. As flash needs to be erased before being written this size
      should at least be equal to the largest erase block size of the flash
      partition. Defaults to block-size if omitted
